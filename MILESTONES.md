**Milestone 1 contents** due: Friday October 30, 4:59pm
- Brief description of your planned program analysis and/or visualisation ideas.
- Notes of any important changes/feedback from TA discussion
- Any planned follow-up tasks or features still to design

We have two ideas in mind for our project idea.  

1. UML Class Diagram visualiser:  
Given a source code directory (or github repo) written in Java, our program will spew out an appropriate UML class diagram-model of the class structure and its relations with each other.  

2. UML Sequence Diagram visualizer:
Given a source code directory (or github repo) written in Java, our program will run the source program and generate a sequence diagram ex  
![Sequence Diagram](assets/sequence_diagram.PNG)  

Some useful feedback from our discussion with the TA is that we should put some more emphasis on the visualization of our analysis; it would be beneficially to display a dynamic chart rather than a static one.  Also, we should also come up with new ways of adding complexity to both our project ideas.

Our followup from this milestone is to sit on creating a project idea over the weekend or add more specifications to our existing ideas and meet on Monday for a group discussion.
